- exit system call is not traced, because it is a different type of probe
  in SystemTap, so it requires special handling.
- blktrace2ds.sh and spc2ds.sh are slow because they do preprocessing using
  shell. Redo it using C.
- RM,RW,R,W operation fields are not converted to 1 or 0 as supposed
- time is relative, not absolute
- offset is in blocks, not in bytes
- enter_time, leave_time and exit_time - are not converted right now.
